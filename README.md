# agda-stdlib-doc

This is work-in-progress documentation for the Agda standard library
that is intended to be especially useful for people who are just
getting started with Agda.

The standard library is large, so I'm prioritizing the parts of it
that I use, which might correspond to things that are also commonly
used by other people.
